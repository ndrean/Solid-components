`dataset` is a way to store data inside an HTML file.


### Create dataset

Anything like `data-xxx` will be a dataset.
- within an HTML file. We can store data in an HTML file writting `<p id=1, data-test-id = "1" data-test2= 2>  Hello </p>`
- dynamically creating with Javascript: with the previous example, we select this paragraph with `const par = document.getElementById('1')`
