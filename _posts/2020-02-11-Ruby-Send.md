title: Ruby, example with Send method
---


The `send` method is another way of calling a method. You can pass in the method you want to call as a parameter.

We take an example:
```ruby
class Car
  attr_accessor :brand, :year, :color
end
```

```
[2] pry(main)> car= Car.new
=> #<Car:0x00007fa27e29e398>
[3] pry(main)> car.brand = 'Ferrari'
=> "Ferrari"
[4] pry(main)> car.color='red'
=> "red"
[5] pry(main)> car.year= 2020
=> 2020
[6] pry(main)> car
=> #<Car:0x00007fa27e29e398 @brand="Ferrari", @color="red", @year=2020>
```

```
[7] pry(main)> attr = [:brand, :year, :color]
=> [:brand, :year, :color]
```
If you iterate through an array of symbols (or strings), this will fail:
```
[8] pry(main)> attr.each {|a| puts car.a }
NoMethodError: undefined method `a' for #<Car:0x00007fa27e29e398>
from (pry):12:in `block in <main>'
```

However, we can `send` the symbols to the object:
```
[9] pry(main)> attr.each {|a| puts car.send(a) }
Ferrari
2020
red
=> [:brand, :year, :color]
```

We can dynamically assgn a method to an object:
```
def dyn_assign (obj, name)
  obj.send(name)
end
```
```
[11] pry(main)> dyn_assign car,:brand
=> "Ferrari"
```


If the Rails app needs to assign attributes to your car object from user input, we can do:
```
params.each do |key, value|
  car.send("#{key}=", value)
```
