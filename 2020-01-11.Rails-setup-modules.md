title: Rails, setup modules
---

If a particular model class is specifiy to my app, the module goes in `app/models`
If the model class has nothing specifically to do with my application (e.g. it’s a utility class that could conceivably be open-sourced and used in any application), it goes in lib.I

## How to set up autoloading for modules located in `/lib`

Modify your `config/application.rb` to include the following line.

```Ruby
# config/application.rb

module MyApp
  class Application < Rails::Application
    config.eager_load_paths += %W(#{config.root}/lib) <-
  end
end
```

## How to define and include a module

for example, we define here a new module `Bonjour` that provides a method `hello` that returns "Hi there" when called.
We create a new module located at  `#/lib/bin` or `#/app/models` like this:

```Ruby
# /lib/bonjour.rb

module Bonjour
  def hello
    "Hi there!"
  end
end
```

We can then use the `hello`method with an ActiveRecord model `User` class by using the `include Bonjour`, the keyword followed by the module name.

```Ruby
# app/models/customer.rb

class Customer < ActiveRecord::Base
  include Bonjour
end
```
and then you are able to do `User.new.hello` and get “Hi there” as a result.
